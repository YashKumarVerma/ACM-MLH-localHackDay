## Version Numbering 

v1.2.3.4 where:

1 is the major release
2 is the minor release
3 is the build number
4 is the revision number

Major Release - Signifies a 'complete' system with whatever features that version was meant to have. Normally any subsequent 'major' versions are rewrites, or architecture changes, or (excuse the redundancy) major changes to the software.

Minor Release - Signifies a less significant release, with perhaps bug fixes, small features added, or any number of other 'minor' events. This could include interface changes and additions. Normally applications should be somewhat compatible in their 'major release' tree, so minor versions of the same major release should be architecturally the same.

Build Number - Generally signifies just bug fixes, small fixes, and are somewhat insignificant in their scope. It could be something as simple as changing the contrast between the foreground and background of the app. Generally, Builds are internal designations such as nightly builds, so you always have a place to revert back to that is stable.

Revision Number - signifies when bug fixes are released or VERY minor enhancements are made. These are generally reserved for just bug fixes -- don't include major feature enhancements 
as revisions.
